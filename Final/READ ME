Hello, 

This is class project.  For that reason. There are currently two primary folders.
CSC202 and EVERYONE ELSE.  Since this is open source everyone should be able to 
participate, but because it is our final exam as well the teacher will need to be 
able to distinguish between student work and others work.  So if you are not in the 
class please copy whatever file you wish to work on from the csc202 folder into the 
everyone else folder and make your changes there.

Thank you!
